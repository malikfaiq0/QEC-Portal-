                            <p>Establishment of quality assurance system in higher education is a global concern now. There is a growing demand for Quality Assurance (QA) mechanisms at national, regional and global levels. Over the years, it is observed that there is an increase in the number of HE institutions and increased involvement of external stakeholders through changes in governance structures. The higher education institutions around the world have been introduced to quality assurance system internally with formal institutional approach and documentation. This has been done with the establishment of quality assurance agencies like accreditation bodies at the national level. The integration of Quality Assurance principles into higher education is also a matter of concern in Pakistan.</p>

                            <p>Quality Enhancement Cell at Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, Karachi is taking deliberate steps to bring about continual improvement in the effectiveness of the learning experience of students. In Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) there is greater emphasis on Internal QA and the encouragement of an institutional “Quality Culture.”</p>

                            <p>M.A. Jinnah University has always been in the forefront for accepting and adapting best practices in the field of Education. Recognizing the role that it has to play in higher education sector, M.A. JINNAH UNIVERSITY has established a Quality Enhancement Cell. This cell has the responsibility to ensure that the university’s quality assurance procedures are compatible with international standards and are designed to improve the quality of higher education.</p>

                            <p>At M.A. JINNAH UNIVERSITY we believe, that quality enhancement and assurance is a collective responsibility and that it is the professionalism and creativity of staff, individually, that makes the most vital contribution to the enhancement of provision, through their attention to their students’ experience as learners, to the development of their disciplines, and their engagement with their teaching practice.</p>

While the BS programs primarily focus on training students who would assume the role of developers, designers, and architects of computing systems, the MS and the PhD programs focus on preparing researchers and academicians. The prospective practitioners in the field of Computer Science and Software Engineering are provided with the necessary skills to construct reliable computing systems by applying scientific, engineering, and management skills, while the prospective researchers are put through rigorous training in the research methodologies. However, the design, the development, and the research activities are structured so as to supplement each other.</p>

                                        <p>Psychology is the need of today’s world. Ranging from clinical, industrial, educational to forensic; psychology can be seen working in all domains and fields. Today the need of Psychology is felt and recognized in every domain where human is working or linked. Psychologists have been working in all departments. Psychology, an essential area of learning, encompasses the many aspects of the human mind and subsequent behaviour. The accurate understanding of these promotes good health and establishes a society which is self-aware, resilient, and better able to maintain healthy relationships. Department of Psychology caters all necessary needs of students related to the field of Psychology. Our program BS-Psychology offers a wide range of specializations. The four-year program focuses on the intricacies of individual differences, and the cultural significance of psychological theories, practices and therapy. Since Psychology is a field that has struggled to be recognized as a science within Pakistan, the launching of this program will aid in furthering our society towards mental and emotional wellbeing.</p>
